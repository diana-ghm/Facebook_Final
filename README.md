A Hackers Journey
=================

> A hackathon is an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative 
> computer programming. Hackathons typically start with one or more presentations about the event, as well as about the specific subject, 
> if any. Then participants suggest ideas and form teams, based on individual interests and skills. Then the main work of the hackathon 
> begins, which can last anywhere from several hours to several days. For hackathons that last 24 hours or longer, especially competitive 
> ones, eating is often informal, with participants often subsisting on food like pizza and energy drinks. Sometimes sleeping is informal as 
> well, with participants sleeping on-site with sleeping bags.
> 
> At the end of hackathons, there is usually a series of demonstrations in which each group presents their results. To capture the great 
> ideas and work-in-progress often people post a video of the demonstrations, blog about results with screenshots and details, share 
> links and progress on social media, suggest a place for open source code and generally make it possible for people to share, learn from 
> and possibly build from the ideas generated and initial work completed. There is sometimes a contest element as well, in which a panel 
> of judges select the winning teams, and prizes are given. At many hackathons, the judges are made up of organizers and sponsors.

> "Hackathons are a big tradition at Facebook. They serve as the foundation for some great (and not so great) ideas. It gives our 
> employees the opportunity to try out new ideas and collaborate with other people in a fun environment."
